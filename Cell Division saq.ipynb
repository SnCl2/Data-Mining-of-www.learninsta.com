      "********************************\n",
      "(b) Isomerisation: There is internal molecular rearrangement to form fructose 6 phosphates. The enzyme is hexose phosphate isomerase.\n",
      "********************************\n",
      "(c) Second phosphorylation: The fructose – 6-phosphate undergoes phosphorylation to form fructose 1,6 diphosphate. One molecule of ATP is consumed. The enzyme is phosphofructokinase.\n",
      "********************************\n",
      "(d) Triose phosphates are 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde (PGAL) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP). The enzyme phosphorize isomerase maintains the two isomers in equilibrium.\n",
      "********************************\n",
      "(e) Phosphorylation and oxidative dehydrogenation: PGAL under¬goes simultaneous phosphorylation and oxidative dehydrogenation to form 1,3 diphosphoglyceric acid.\n",
      "********************************\n",
      "(f) ATP generation: 1,3 diphosphoglyceric acid transfers its phosphate with a high energy bond to ADP to form ATP and 3-phosphoric acid. One molecule of ATP is produced from one triose molecule.\n",

      "Question 3.\n",
      "How cytokinesis is different in an animal and a plant cell?\n",
      "Answer:\n",
      "Cytokinesis in plant and animal cells: The separation of daughter nuclei and cytokinesis or cell cleavage maybe two different processes. The first visible changes consist of an appearance of dense material around the microtubules at the equator of the spindle at either mid or late phase then although spindle the fibre tends to disorganize and disappear during telophase, they usually persist and may even increase in number at the equator, frequently intermingled with a row of vesicles and the dense material.\n",
      "********************************\n",
      "The entire structure is called the midbody. Simultaneously there is a depression on the cell surface a kind of constriction that deepens gradually until reaching the midbody with the completion of the furrowing, the separation of cells is concluded.\n",
      "********************************\n",
      "The phragmoplast begins to form in the mid anaphase of plant cells. Under the electron microscope, it is possible to observe that the vesicles are of dense material applied together to their surface. The vesicles are derived from Golgi complexes which are found in the regions adjacent to phrag¬moplast which migrate to the equatorial region to be clustered around the microtubules.\n",
      "********************************\n",
      "Although phragmoplast is initially found as a ring on the periphery of the cell, with time it grows centripetally by the addition of microtubules and partition until it extends across the entire equatorial plane. The vesicles increase in size and just until the two cells are separated by a fairly continuous plasma membrane.\n",
      "********************************\n",
      "All this time the phragmoplast has been transformed into, cell plate. Thin cytoplasmic connection is plasmoids- data transverse the cell plate and remain in place for communication between the adjacent daughter cells.\n",
      "********************************\n",
      "The formation of the cell plate also leads to the synthesis of the cell wall. The Golgi-vesicles in phragmoplast is already filled with secretory material consisting mainly of the pectin. The fusion of vesicles results in the combining of the pectin in the extracellular space between the two daughter cells thereby forming the main body of the periphery cell wall.\n",
